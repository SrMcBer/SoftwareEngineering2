## 📌 Project Overview

VetTrack is a simple and practical tool designed for small veterinary clinics.  
Its main goal is to help veterinarians **organize and maintain accurate patient records**, including:

- Last visit and reason for visit  
- Ongoing treatments and medications  
- Notes and clinical history  
- Recent patient activity and follow-up reminders  

The initial scope considers only one clinic, with two roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Veterinarian (User)** | Views and updates patient records. |
| **Admin** | Manages users and basic system setup. |
