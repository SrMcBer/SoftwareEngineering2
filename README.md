# SoftwareEngineering2

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains coursework and materials for a Software Engineering course. The repository is organized into four workshop folders (Workshop 1-4), each containing exercises and materials for the respective workshop sessions.

## Main Project: Veterinary Patient Management System

The main project for this course is developing a system to help veterinarians quickly view, update, and audit the status of their patients. 

### Project Overview

The Veterinary Patient Management System will enable veterinarians to efficiently manage patient information including:

- **Last Visit**: Track when each patient last visited the clinic
- **Reason for Visit**: Document the purpose of each visit
- **Ongoing Treatments/Medications**: Monitor current treatment plans and prescribed medications
- **Recent Activities**: Log and review recent patient activities and interactions

This system aims to streamline the workflow of veterinary practices by providing quick access to critical patient information and maintaining comprehensive patient records.
